<!-- 5) Part 5: Create a well-designed website using JQuery: 
The website should be designed using jQuery similar to this class example website: https://cs.nyu.edu/~odeh/2023WebDev/Javascript/jquery/website/

1. Place all files for this part inside a folder called jQweb which should be placed inside assignment#6 folder.
2. This folder should have an index.html with an external .js and .css.
3. Content of this website can be related to any theme you care about such as creating your own portfolio, or any other topics.   
4. You should have a background image similar to class example, a heading, and 4 navigational links.
5. Each of the above links can load a video, an image, text (one <p> tags), and a link to an outside URL.  
6. Make sure to use jQuery events and functions such as hide(), show(), fadeIn(), and so on. Make sure to customize the design and content. -->
