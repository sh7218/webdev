/*JavaScript  Requirements:
 
You need to create 1 J one external javascript file called asg4.js (sign.js).  
 
Make sure to place all the scripts and files for this assignment inside asg4 folder.

Guidelines:

Your html page should include an input field with type=date.
You should have a button with onclick="sign()" to check their sign.
Link to an external sign.js
Tip: You can have a multidimensional array called mysign that will include for each sign the following: 
the first Month for the sign, the 2nd Month for the sign, the first day and the last day for the first month range, 
the first day and the last day for the 2nd month range for that sign, the name of the sign, the fortune, 
and finally, the image src for that sign.

Provide the output in the same page inside a textarea field with no id used for this form value. 
Make sure the webpage is well designed.

function sign()
{

// get the date value from the form
const objValue = document.querySelector("#mydate").value;

// create date object based on value (birthday) from the user
let mydate = new Date(objValue);

// get the day and the month

let birthDate = mydate.getUTCDate(); 

let birthMonth = mydate.getUTCMonth() + 1;

console.log(birthMonth); //

// set up multi arrays for Zodiac Signs
let mysign = new Array (12);

// initialize the multidimensional array manually for each row
// initialize the multidimensional arrays with these elements:
// [startMonth,  start date for first month, end date for first month, endMonth, start date for 2nd month, end date for 2nd month, holiday name, image source]
